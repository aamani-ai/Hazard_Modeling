# Notebooks — hazard modeling, organized `peril → asset`

Worked, end-to-end notebooks for the **Hazard Risk** tier. The folder layout mirrors the model
itself — a **(peril × asset)** matrix — and turns on one structural fact:

- **M0 (raw data) + M1 (event catalog + frequency) are the PERIL** — *asset-independent*. A hail
  catalog over a region is the same whether a solar farm or a wind farm sits under it.
- **M2 (coupling) → M3 (damage) → M4 (loss & metrics) are the (peril × asset) CELL** — they
  specialize to the asset's geometry, fragility, and value.

So perils are top-level folders; each asset is a subfolder that **reuses the shared catalog** and
adds its own coupling/damage/loss.

## The matrix — what's built, what's next

Rows = perils, columns = asset types; each cell = the **coupling type** (how the hazard *reaches* the
asset). This is the heart of **"standard interface, not standard physics"**
([principle](../docs/principles/hazard_asset_specificity.md)): every cell runs the *same* M0→M4
interface, but the **coupling physics changes per (peril × asset)**.

| Peril ↓ \ Asset → | Solar PV *(dense areal polygon)* | Onshore wind *(turbine point-cloud)* | Offshore wind | BESS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Hail** | **areal hit-or-miss ✅ built** | per-turbine hit-or-miss — **next** | — | areal (point) |
| **Tornado** *(convective wind)* | areal hit-or-miss | **areal hit-or-miss, path-aware ✅ built** | — | — |
| **Straight-line wind** *(convective wind)* | site-conditioned | **site-conditioned ✅ built** | site-conditioned | site-conditioned |
| Hurricane wind | **field-intensity ✅ built** | **field-intensity ✅ built** | field-intensity | field-intensity |
| **Wildfire (flame)** | **site-conditioned ✅ built** | site-conditioned | — | site-conditioned |
| Flood | **site-conditioned ✅ built** | **site-conditioned ✅ built** | (surge) | site-conditioned |
| Winter (snow / ice) | field-intensity | field-intensity | — | field-intensity |

> **Convective wind = one peril, two sub-perils** (tornado [T] + strong/straight-line wind [W]) — built as
> `convective_wind/wind_farm/` (M2 folder-forks per sub-peril; M3/M4 shared). **Hurricane** is a *separate* peril
> (field-intensity) — it shares only the 3-s-gust damage curve, not the catalog.

✅ = built end-to-end. Everything else is roadmap. **The three coupling types** (the M2 physics):
**areal hit-or-miss** (finite footprint covers the asset or misses — Minkowski `(√F+√s)²/A`) ·
**field-intensity** (continuous field sampled at the asset) · **site-conditioned** (field × per-asset
susceptibility, e.g. elevation / fuel). Source: A21 coupling-type dispatch + A12 peril×asset taxonomy —
with full provenance (external citations + research-repo links) in [`docs/references/`](../docs/references/README.md).

## Start here

- **[`hail/`](hail/README.md)** — the hail peril (shared catalog + the per-asset pipelines).
- **[`hail/solar/`](hail/solar/README.md)** — hail × solar, the first cell built end-to-end (M2→M4),
  with the headline risk numbers.
- **[`wildfire/solar/`](wildfire/solar/m4_loss_metrics/README.md)** — wildfire × solar (site-conditioned).
- **[`convective_wind/`](convective_wind/README.md)** — the convective-wind peril (two sub-perils + the shared catalog).
- **[`convective_wind/wind_farm/`](convective_wind/wind_farm/README.md)** — convective wind × wind farm: **two
  sub-perils** (tornado + strong wind) on one shared catalog, M2 folder-forked, M3 one turbine / two curves, M4 combined.
- **[`hurricane/`](hurricane/README.md)** — hurricane wind, field-intensity coupling, solar + wind-farm cells.
- **[`flood/`](flood/README.md)** — flood, three sub-perils, solar + wind-farm cells.

## Why solar and a wind farm differ (now built)

A **solar farm** is a *dense areal polygon* — panels fill a contiguous boundary, so "did the footprint
cover the plant?" ≈ loss fraction → **areal hit-or-miss**. A **wind farm** is a *sparse cloud of point
turbines* (we have the turbine lat/longs) scattered across a large lease — so a bounding-polygon area
*overcounts*; you intersect the footprint with the **turbine points** (which turbines are hit), and
wind loads sample a **continuous field at each turbine**. Same M0→M4 interface, genuinely different M2
coupling. (A21's *"wind-farm open question"* is now **resolved in [`convective_wind/wind_farm/`](convective_wind/wind_farm/README.md)**:
tornado intersects the farm footprint **path-aware** + swept-fraction; strong wind reads the **site RP gust**.)

## M0-M4: What The Notebook Layers Ask

```text
M0 asks:
  what raw source evidence exists?
  what does the source variable mean?
  what units, grain, coverage, and bias traps matter?

M1 asks:
  what asset-independent hazard object is emitted?
  is it an event catalog, return-period curve, pre-integrated profile, or hybrid?
  what frequency and severity information goes forward?

M2 asks:
  how does the hazard reach this asset?
  is coupling areal hit/miss, site-conditioned, field-intensity, or per-node?
  what p_hit, exposure fraction, or local intensity is emitted?

M3 asks:
  if the hazard reaches the asset, how much damage does it cause?
  what component curves and capex weights create the asset damage ratio?
  what full conditional loss goes forward?

M4 asks:
  over many simulated years, what losses are realized?
  what are AEP and OEP?
  what are EAL, PML/VaR, and TVaR?
```

If a README feels confusing, it should be rewritten until it can answer those questions in a few lines.

## Environment

`source ../.venv/bin/activate`, then register the kernel:
`python -m ipykernel install --user --name hazard_modeling`. Keep heavy data out of git
([`../.gitignore`](../.gitignore)) — read from `data/` or cloud sources rather than committing large files.
